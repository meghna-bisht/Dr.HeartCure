# Dr.HeartCure
This is an arduino based pulse rate monitoring system along with body temperature and height measuring feature. The system upon taking input from the Pulse Sensor, the Digital humidity and temperature sensor ( DHT11 ), will help the user keep record of his heart rate and body temperature and notify the user via the Voice Record and Playback sensor ( ISD1820 ) in case of high pulse rate and body temperature ( fever )  . 

TOOLS AND FRAMEWORK USED : Arduino IDE, Arduino UNO, Pulse Sensor, Digital Humidity and Temperature Sensor ( DHT11 ), Ultrasonic Sensor, Voice Record and Playback sensor ( ISD1820 )
