# Dr.HeartCure
This is an arduino based pulse rate monitoring system along with body temperature and height measuring feature. The system upon taking input from the Pulse Sensor, the Digital humidity and temperature sensor ( DHT11 ) and the Ultrasonic Sensor will help the user keep record of his heart rate and body temperature and notify the user via the Voice Record and Playback sensor ( ISD1820 ) in case of high pulse rate and body temperature ( fever )  . 
The main objective of the project is to provide the users with an easily accessible smart solution for basic medical facilities at home.
After the campaign is over, we plan to integrate machine learning with the present modules for better results and host the application on a database which can be further used in hospitals to reduce paperwork and save crucial time of the patient.

TOOLS AND FRAMEWORK USED : Arduino IDE, Arduino UNO, Pulse Sensor, Digital Humidity and Temperature Sensor ( DHT11 ), Ultrasonic Sensor, Voice Record and Playback sensor ( ISD1820 )
